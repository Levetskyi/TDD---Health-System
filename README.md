# TDD Health System Feature

This repository implements a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to creating a Health System feature for a game. The Health System feature consists of managing a player's health through heart containers, each containing multiple hearts.

Feature Overview

- Heart Container: The player's health is represented by a series of heart containers. Each heart container contains multiple hearts, which act as health indicators.
- Heart Pieces: Each heart is composed of multiple pieces, representing the player's health status. When damaged, pieces are depleted, and when healed, pieces are replenished.
- Damage and Healing: The player can take damage from various sources or be healed through gameplay mechanics.
